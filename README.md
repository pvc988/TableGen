# TableGen

This is not yet another parser generator. This program generates LR(1) and LALR(1) parsing tables as binary file from supplied grammar file. Generated tables are language agnostic. Table files can be used to create any kind of parser using any programming language. Generated files contain just enough information to create any parser, ranging from simple educational ones to complete programming languages like C.
